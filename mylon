in five years i see myself either at a hbcu or in college with a car and a job and i want to go to hair school.
my ideal career path is to go to become a police officer, a Special Victims Unit detective, a lawyer and, a judge in that order and invest in businesses.
i would like to live in oakland because i dont want leave. but i would like to vacation in different places like new orleans, france, and the uk
