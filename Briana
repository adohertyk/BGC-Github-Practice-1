Where I see myself in 5 years is in college and going to law school studying more about that major and my other career that i have is being a sou chef because i love cooking and baking.
My ideal career path is going to either law school for studying about criminal investagator or trade school like doing culinary for cooking and baking
Where I like to live in the future probably living at Los Vegas or new york
